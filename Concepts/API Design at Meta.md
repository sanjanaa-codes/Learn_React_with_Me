## 📘 API Design at Meta

### Overview

APIs are the backbone of applications like Facebook and Instagram. They power the exchange of data — photos, likes, comments — between the front-end and back-end. Without APIs, there’s no functional app experience.

### ⚙️ Design Process

* **Collaborative Proposal:**
  Engineers draft an API design document outlining its structure and agreements between system components.
* **Review & Iteration:**
  Peers review, comment, and improve the proposal before implementation.
* **Implementation & Code Review:**
  The API is built based on the approved design, followed by code reviews and further refinements.
* **Cross-Team Collaboration:**
  Front-end, back-end, and middleware engineers work together to ensure consistency and reliability across the stack.

### 🔒 Core Principles

1. **Type Safety:**
   Guarantees data consistency — if you request a photo, you get a photo, not a video.
   Prevents mismatched data errors and improves app stability.
2. **Simplicity:**
   Avoid over-engineering; prioritize readability, maintainability, and stability.
3. **Future Compatibility:**
   Design with foresight — anticipate evolution but don’t overbuild. Balance current needs with scalability.

### 🚀 Advice for Developers

* Learning APIs introduces back-end complexity — embrace it; it enhances your skill set and career value.
* Don’t fear the scope or complexity. Focus on clarity, consistency, and collaboration.
* Keep APIs **simple, stable, and bug-free** — simplicity wins over complexity.

**💡 Key Takeaway:**

> “APIs are the language between systems. Design them with clarity, safety, and simplicity — that’s what keeps great applications running.”
